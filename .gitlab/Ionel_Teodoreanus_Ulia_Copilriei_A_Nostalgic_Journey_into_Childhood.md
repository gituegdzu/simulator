UliÅ£a CopilÄriei is a collection of short stories that narrate the childhood memories of the author, who grew up in a small town in Moldavia, near the border with Bessarabia. The stories are told from the perspective of the narrator's older brother, who recalls with nostalgia and humor the adventures and mischiefs of his younger brother, nicknamed ScÃ¢ncea-Voievod (Squeak-Voivode).
 
The stories are full of charm and warmth, as they portray the simple joys and sorrows of childhood, the bond between siblings and friends, the fascination with nature and animals, the discovery of love and literature, and the contrast between the urban and rural worlds. The stories also reflect the historical and cultural context of Romania at the turn of the century, when it was undergoing modernization and facing political and social challenges.
 
The title of the book refers to the humble and quiet street where the narrator's family lived, which was a source of inspiration and freedom for the children. The street was also a symbol of their identity and belonging, as they felt alienated from the other streets of the town, which were more crowded and noisy. The street was their playground, their refuge, their home.
 
UliÅ£a CopilÄriei is a book that can be enjoyed by readers of all ages, as it evokes the universal feelings and experiences of childhood. It is also a valuable testimony of a bygone era, when life was simpler and more innocent. It is a book that celebrates the beauty and wonder of childhood, as well as the power and magic of storytelling.
  
The book consists of 12 stories, each one focusing on a different aspect or episode of the narrator's childhood. The stories are not arranged chronologically, but rather thematically, creating a mosaic of impressions and emotions. Some of the stories are:
 
- "UliÅ£a CopilÄriei" ("The Street of Childhood"), which introduces the main characters and setting of the book, and describes the street as a living entity that changes with the seasons and the moods of the children.
- "MieluÅelul" ("The Little Lamb"), which tells the story of how the narrator and his brother received a toy lamb as a gift from their father, and how they played with it and cared for it as if it were real.
- "PÄsÄrile" ("The Birds"), which recounts the narrator's fascination with birds and his attempts to catch them and keep them as pets, as well as his admiration for a mysterious bird-catcher who lived in their street.
- "CÃ¢inele" ("The Dog"), which narrates the tragic fate of a stray dog that befriended the children and protected them from bullies, but was eventually killed by a cruel policeman.
- "CÄlÄtoriile" ("The Travels"), which describes the narrator's journeys to different places with his family or friends, such as the countryside, the seaside, or Bessarabia, and how they opened his eyes to new realities and cultures.
- "Cartea" ("The Book"), which reveals the narrator's passion for reading and writing, and how he discovered his favorite authors and genres, such as Jules Verne, Alexandre Dumas, or fairy tales.
- "Iubirea" ("Love"), which depicts the narrator's first love for a girl named Maria, who lived in their street, and how he tried to impress her and win her heart.

The book ends with a story called "Adio!" ("Farewell!"), which marks the end of the narrator's childhood and his departure from his beloved street. He reflects on the changes that have occurred in his life and in his town, and expresses his gratitude and nostalgia for his childhood memories.
