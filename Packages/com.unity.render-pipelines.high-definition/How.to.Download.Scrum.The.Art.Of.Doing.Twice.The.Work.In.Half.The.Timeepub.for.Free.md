Scrum is based on the idea that people are spectacularly bad at doing things with agility and efficiency, and that the best way to overcome this is to work in small, self-organizing teams that deliver value in short iterations called sprints. Scrum also emphasizes deep accountability, team interaction, and constant iterative improvement, which can lead to amazing results in any domain where leaders wrestle with complex projects.
 
In this book, you will learn how Scrum can help you achieve what others consider unachievable, whether it be inventing a trailblazing technology, devising a new system of education, pioneering a way to feed the hungry, or building a foundation for your family to thrive and prosper. You will also discover how Scrum has been applied to various real-world scenarios, such as bringing the FBI into the 21st century, perfecting the design of an affordable 140 mile per hour/100 mile per gallon car, helping NPR report fast-moving action in the Middle East, changing the way pharmacists interact with patients, reducing poverty in the Third World, and even helping people plan their weddings and accomplish weekend chores.
